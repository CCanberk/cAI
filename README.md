# OpenAI Powered Website Design Assistant
This project is a website design assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. It helps users generate website design ideas based on their selected site category, design style, and target audience. The output is presented in bullet points, providing a clear and concise guide for website creation.

## Usage
To use the website design assistant, simply select the site category, design style, and target audience on the homepage. Once submitted, the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model will generate a list of website design ideas based on the selected options. The output is presented on a separate page and can be easily copied and pasted into a document or used as inspiration for your website design.

## Technology Used
This project is built using Python and the Flask web framework. The OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model is used to generate website design ideas. The application is hosted on PythonAnywhere, a cloud-based Python hosting platform.

## Installation
To run the application locally, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. Clone the project from GitHub and install the necessary dependencies using the following command:


`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To use the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model, you will need to obtain an API key from the OpenAI website and set it as an environment variable. Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project, and add the following line:

`OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`

Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key. This file should not be committed to version control, as it contains sensitive information.

Once dependencies are installed and the API key is set up, the application can be run using the following command:

`python start.py`

## GPT-4 Powered Chatbot
The entire codebase of this project was created by having a conversation with OpenAI's GPT-4 language model. I described the website design assistant I wanted to build, and GPT-4 provided me with the code to make it happen. All of the Python code, HTML templates, and CSS stylesheets were generated by GPT-4, making this a truly unique and innovative project.

## Future Work
In the future, we plan to integrate the latest GPT-4 language model to improve the quality and accuracy of the website design ideas generated. Additionally, we plan to add more customization options to allow users to further refine their design requirements.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank OpenAI for their amazing language models and API. Without their technology, this project would not have been possible.

We would also like to thank Flask, PythonAnywhere, and all the other open-source projects used in this project. Your contributions are greatly appreciated.
